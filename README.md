# Evil Space Dragon VI

An iPhone game inspired by Brandon Trebitowski's tennis game (http://brandontreb.com). There's a spooky space dragon shooting deadly fire at you.  You have to shoot him first.

You can build locally using XCode and the iOS Simulator.  Download Xcode here -

Clone the repo.  Fire up Xcode.  Open the outermost folder with Xcode *File=>Open*.  Then *Project=>Run* and the game should pop up in iOS Simulator.

The game is built to be controlled by a swiping finger. Just left-click and move your mouse to simluate.  Your spaceship will move with mouse and fire blasts when you lift your finger up.  Don't get hit with space dragon's fireballs or you will die.  Hit him four times and you win!
